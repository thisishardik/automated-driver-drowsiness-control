## Automated Driver Drowsiness Control Technology Using Artificial Intelligence based Decision Support System

The main purpose of this project is to develop the methodology to detect and predict driver drowsiness at the early stages using physical and physiological variables. A feasibility test is conducted to evaluate the accuracy and performance of the proposed methodology. AI techniques and Google Vision API for Android are utilized to analyze data for monitoring, detecting, predicting and controlling driver drowsiness. Finally, the android application is prepared end-to-end for the user and applied for data collection in the future research experiments.
